## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Images Not Displaying

1. **Check Image URLs**:

   - Check if image paths are correct in the API response
   - Verify that the field name in Strapi matches what your frontend expects (FeaturedImage)

2. **CORS Issues**:
   - Configure CORS settings in Strapi (Settings > Global Settings > CORS)
   - Add your frontend domain to the allowed origins

3. **Media Provider Issues**:
   - Check if your media provider is properly configured
   - For local development, ensure files are being saved correctly

### API Response Issues

1. **Data Structure Changes**:
   - Check if the API response structure matches what your frontend expects
   - Make sure the field names in Strapi (like FeaturedImage and pub_at) are properly transformed in your frontend code
   - Use the API documentation in Strapi or check network responses

2. **Authorization Issues**:
   - Verify that your API token is valid
   - Check that public permissions are set correctly

### Frontend Display Issues

1. **Debug Console Logs**:
   - Add console.log statements in your frontend code to log API responses
   - Verify the data structure matches what your components expect

2. **Image Fallbacks**:
   - Always include fallback UI for when images fail to load
   - Add error handling for API requests

## Production Deployment

   ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your_secured_admin_jwt_token
   JWT_SECRET=your_secured_jwt_token
   API_TOKEN_SALT=your_secured_api_token_salt
   ```

2. Configure database (recommended: PostgreSQL for production):
   - Update database config in `config/database.js`

3. Configure file uploads (recommended: cloud storage for production):
   - Update upload config in `config/plugins.js`
